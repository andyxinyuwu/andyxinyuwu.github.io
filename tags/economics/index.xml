      <description>We live in a world with complex systems. Complex systems are non-linear, dynamic, resilient, self-organizing, and its participants have bounded rationality (coined by Herbert Simon).
Due to these natures, complex systems cannot be controlled or predicted. Instead, it evolves all the time. Take financial market as an example, participants are learning all the time and the reactions are non-linear due to all the financial tools. Information within the financial system also flows faster and faster nowadays.</description>
