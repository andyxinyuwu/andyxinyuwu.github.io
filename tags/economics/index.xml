      <description>There are numerous news and posts covering Silicon Valley Bank situation. This post aims to explain the core of the issue in a clear question and answer way.
Q: Why did SVB Fail?
A: Because of bank run.
Q: How could bank run cause such a big problem in 2023 after FDIC are introduced?

      <description>A few days ago I watched a video online about interest rate. A comment under the video caught my eye:
 Rich people earn money from their interest-bearing savings. Poor people need to pay the debt interest. High interest rate increases wealth inequality. As a poor, I hope to live in the world of low interest rate.
 While I understand the rationale behind it, there might be another aspect to this issue.</description>
